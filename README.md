# PiggyAI: Universal AI Subscription Platform

## üê∑ The Vision

What if you could access ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and every other AI service through a single "piggy bank" of credits instead of juggling multiple subscriptions?

This repository documents the complete concept for a universal AI subscription platform - from initial vision to technical architecture to business model.

## üìã Repository Contents

TBA 

## üéØ Core Concept

**Problem:** AI users face subscription chaos - $20/month for ChatGPT Plus, $18 for Claude Pro, $20 for Gemini Advanced, $30 for Grok Premium. Most want multiple services but delay subscribing due to decision paralysis.

**Solution:** Universal AI credits. Load your piggy bank once, spend anywhere. Smart routing automatically selects the best AI model for each task.

## üîß Key Innovations

- **Universal Credit System** - One payment method for all AI services
- **Intelligent Request Routing** - ML system that picks optimal model per query
- **Cross-Platform Analytics** - Usage insights across all AI tools
- **Viral Growth Mechanics** - Invitation system with network effects

## üìÖ Timeline

- **August 28, 2025** - Initial concept and documentation
- **Public Disclosure** - Prior art establishment to prevent restrictive patenting

## ü§ù Open Innovation

This concept is released as **prior art** to prevent any single company from monopolizing universal AI access through patents. The vision belongs in the public domain.

Build it, improve it, compete with it - but nobody gets to own the fundamental idea.

## üöÄ For Builders

If you're inspired to build this:

1. The market timing is perfect (subscription fatigue + AI proliferation)
2. Start with smaller AI providers who need distribution
3. Focus on power users first, expand from there
4. The network effects are real - whoever gets users first has huge advantages

## üìú Legal Note

All concepts, methods, and systems described in this repository constitute prior art as of August 28, 2025. This disclosure is intentionally public to preserve innovation freedom in the AI subscription space.
